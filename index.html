								<p>You can think of coronavirus as a more lethal form of cold and flu. It spreads just as easily as cold and flu, however we do not have an effective cure or vaccine against it right now, so it is crucial for you to do what you can to prevent the spread of coronavirus. This way we can buy our scientists some time in order for them to develop vaccines and cures. Many people who carry coronavirus may not exhibit any cold or flu symptoms, which is why it is important that we all work together to prevent the spread of this deadly disease. We need you to do your part to prevent yourself from being infected by coronavirus, by doing so you also prevent your family, friends and colleagues from being infected by this deadly disease. </p>

								<p>After you’ve finished reading these steps, you should share this website with everyone you know (www.stopcorona.org). Coronavirus is spreading around the world at an alarming speed, let’s spread this article faster than coronavirus and stop it in its tracks!</p>

								</div>
								<ol class="numbered-list-wrapper">
									<li>Practise frequent hand washing with soap and water (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);</li>
									<li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 30 seconds (scrub between your fingers, sing happy birthday twice!);</li>
									<li>Avoid touching your face (eyes, nose and mouth) with unwashed hands;</li>
									<li>Apply hand sanitizer if you suspect your hands are contaminated;</li>
									<li>Clean your hands before eating by applying hand sanitizer or washing your hands;</li>
									<li>Avoid crowds and large gatherings. Wear a n95 or surgical mask when going to crowded public places (such as movie theaters, shopping malls, and restaurants) or using public transport;</li>
									<!-- <li>Avoid eating raw or undercooked meat and eggs;</li> -->
									<li>Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and avoid consumption of raw and undercooked meat and eggs;</li>
									<li>When coughing or sneezing, use a tissue or your elbow to cover your mouth. Dispose of the tissue in a rubbish bin promptly;</li>
									<!-- <li>Avoid contact with people that exhibit cold and flu symptoms;</li> -->
									<li>Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;</li>
									<li>Observe good personal hygiene;</li>
									<li>Wash your hands when you arrive at home;</li>
									<!-- <li>Avoid contact with farm and wild animals;</li> -->
									<li>Avoid traveling to infected areas and high risk areas;</li>
									<li>Avoid shaking hands where possible;</li>
									<li>Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath to avoid contaminating people around you;</li>
									<li>Practise self-quarantine if you are feeling unwell or exhibit the following symptoms: fever, respiratory symptoms (including coughing and shortness of breath), headache, muscle pain or diarrhoea. See this <u><a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/ConditionsAndTreatments/quarantine-at-home-coping-tips">Self Quarantine Guide</a></u>;</li>
									<li>Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell. Depending on the country you reside in, you may need to call the medical emergency number instead of going to the hospital to avoid contaminating other patients in the waiting room;</li>
									<li>If anyone in your home is exhibiting coronavirus symptoms, aim to maintain good ventilation at home. Opening windows and doors will help to contain the virus by dispersing any particles that might otherwise adhere to surfaces and people.</li>
									<li>Maintain a healthy lifestyle to keep your immune system strong. You can do so by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight and getting adequate sleep.</li>
									</br>
									<p>By following these steps, you will help prevent the spread of coronavirus and protecting yourself and others around you from this deadly disease.</p>
