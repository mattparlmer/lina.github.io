								<p>You can think of coronavirus as a more lethal form of cold and flu. It spreads just as easily as cold and flu, however we do not have an effective cure or vaccine against it right now, so it is crucial for you to do what you can to prevent the spread of coronavirus. This way we can buy our scientists some time in order for them to develop vaccines and cures. Many people who carry coronavirus may not exhibit any cold or flu symptoms, which is why it is important that we all work together to prevent the spread of this deadly disease. We need you to do your part to prevent yourself from being infected by coronavirus, by doing so you also prevent your family, friends and colleagues from being infected by this deadly disease.</p>

								<p>After you’ve finished reading these steps, you should share this website with everyone you know (www.stopcorona.org). Coronavirus is spreading around the world at an alarming speed, let’s spread this article faster than coronavirus and stop it in its tracks!</p>
